        <article class=question>
            <strong>What do you see yourself doing after completing this program? What career or position interests you?
                Why? What do you hope to have learned in four years?</strong>
            <p>After graduation, I hope to re-enter the job market with a degree in a rapidly growing and increasingly
            important sector. I'm open to potentially pursuing a part-time cybersecurity degree. Once I complete my
            studies, I hope to find work for the government, municipality, or defense sector. If that doesn't work out,
            I wouldn't mind working for larger or international companies.</p>

            <p>I'm not entirely sure which program I want to pursue yet, data scientist or software engineer, but I'm
            leaning
            towards data scientist. I'm interested in working with and optimizing large amounts of data. I'm incredibly
            interested in learning how to use different data, algorithms, and make predictions. While I'm interested in
            learning how to use and predict with data, I can't deny that I'm also very interested in learning how to
            program, developing software myself, testing it, improving it, and successfully applying it.</p>

            <p>In four years, I hope to have learned enough to have a solid foundation for working in the IT sector. That I
            have enough knowledge to deploy myself broadly in different sectors and have more opportunities to possibly
            learn further within the world of ICT.</p>

            <strong>Do you got a (side)job?</strong>

            <input checked id="no" type="radio" value="no" name="yes-no2"><label for>no</label>

        <article class=question>
            <strong>Do you have a hobby or interest that you would like to share?</strong>
            <p> My hobbies are reading, drawing/painting, and exploring nature and history.</p>
                
            <p>Reading fiction is something I've done since childhood. I love losing myself in a good story with a
            well-developed world. Although I don't do it very often, I also really enjoy building my own worlds and
            writing stories for Dungeons & Dragons.</p>

            <p>Drawing and painting is also something I've been doing since elementary school. It's one of the few ways I
            can creatively express my emotions and feelings.</p>

            <p>Exploring nature is a moment of calm for me. It calms me down, and I always feel energized afterward.</p>

            <p>I've always loved history. I can really immerse myself in it. The stories, evidence and mythos surrounding it
            have
            always fascinated me.</p>
